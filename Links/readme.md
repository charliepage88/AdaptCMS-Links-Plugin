# Links

This is the Links Plugin, featuring a full admin interface with ability to use text or image links. In the frontend, the Links Plugin uses AJAX to track click amounts without hurting SEO of the web addresses.

## Installation

The Links plugin is included and installed by default, but if you delete it manually or picked the no-plugin install, then read below:

To install, first download the zip and unpack the folder inside into your 'app/Old_Plugins' folder - be sure to chmod this new folder to 755. Then login into your admin panel and click on 'Manage Plugins'. You should see this plugin listed and an option to install on the right side.
Simply click that and click continue on the install and everything should be done!
